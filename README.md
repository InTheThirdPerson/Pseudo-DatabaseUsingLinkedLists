Pseudo-Database Using Linked Lists
==================================

This application is designed to imitate a database using linked list data structures written in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

- Currently supports: The application opens with three buttons; one to display all the relevant data to the a parts 'model number', one to delete the last item entered into the 'parts' table, and one to close the program. The user can select any button. Selecting the Display Parts By Model Number button will bring up a new window asking for the model number to find, then one by one, the application displays a new window with all the relevant data for each item by displaying a new window with only one option 'okay'. This option closes the window to display the next relevant item to be displayed [if any]. The delete button will warn the user that it will delete the last item input into the parts table. All relevant data about customer purchases, in the customers table, remains for record-keeping purposes.
